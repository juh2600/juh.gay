# whatcha up to?

here are some things i'm working on or learning:

- doing more with docker, including trying to move my daily driver to [Kasm Workspaces](https://kasmweb.com/) (there's a line of yaks out the door, we'll get there). gpus are hell
- learning basic EE things, hoping to someday do less-basic EE things
- setting up the garage i can't afford in the bedroom i don't use, for servers, resin printing, soldering, probing, and rebuilding my jeep
- i'd like to get into kubernetes
- i'd also like to get into bare metal orchestration, which is obviously a horrific battlefield of incompatible technologies and partially-implemented standards and vendors being stupid and ancient open-source projects and
