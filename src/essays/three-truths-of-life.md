# three-ish truths of life

I learned three things in the first twenty or so years of my life. (I didn't pick up on them until I was about 23, really.) Here they are:

- At school, I learned that you can't trust other people.
- At the Boy Scouts, I learned that you can't lead people who don't want to be led.
- At home, I learned that there's only one person whose actions you can control, and that's you.

Now...if you're paying attention, you can see pretty clearly that these are all the same lesson; the last one sums it up best in my opinion. That's how my dad always put it, and I sure wish I'd taken it to heart a lot sooner. You're only responsible for your actions, no one else's, and you are responsible for _all_ of your actions---no one else can be.

We can extend this lesson to a few more practical ideas:

- Never trust a cable you didn't run yourself.
- Don't sign off on it until you've seen it with your own eyes and know that it is good.
- When approaching a problem that has been solved jankily by someone else, don't assume that the obvious solution didn't pan out. Ask if they've tried it; they may not have.
- Write tests.
- Just because someone says that it's documented doesn't mean that it's documented.
