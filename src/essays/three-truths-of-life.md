# three-ish truths of life

I learned three things in the first twenty or so years of my life. (I didn't pick up on them until I was about 23, really.) Here they are:

- At school, I learned that you can't trust other people.
- At the Boy Scouts, I learned that you can't lead people who don't want to be led.
- At home, I learned that there's only one person whose actions you can control, and that's you.

Now...if you're paying attention, you can see pretty clearly that these are all the same lesson; the last one sums it up best in my opinion. That's how my dad always put it, and I sure wish I'd taken it to heart a lot sooner. You're only responsible for your actions, no one else's, and you are responsible for _all_ of your actions---no one else can be.

We can extend this lesson to a few more practical ideas:

- Never trust a cable you didn't run yourself.
- Don't sign off on it until you've seen it with your own eyes and know that it is good.
- When approaching a problem that has been solved jankily by someone else, don't assume that the obvious solution didn't pan out. Ask if they've tried it; they may not have.
- Write tests.
- Just because someone says that it's documented doesn't mean that it's documented.

## 2024 update

Ironically, I have learned this one at work:

- That's not my job.

This flies in the face of "you have to do it yourself", doesn't it? Well, here's the thing: it depends on whether you care about the thing getting done. If you want it to get done, you have to do it yourself. If it's business, getting it done is a business problem, not a you problem. If a partner isn't pulling their weight at work, that's between them and their management chain. It's not your job to pick up slack that you are not trained for, paid for, or invested in.
