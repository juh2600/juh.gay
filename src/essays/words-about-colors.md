# colors, man

Colors are neat. You can use them to make things safer, easier and prettier, or you can use them to make things harder to use and painful to look at. Let's try using them for good, eh? I'll probably add to this article over time when the mood strikes.

## Overuse of high-visibility colors

This topic was the reason I started this article. I recently began mentoring an FRC team, and attended a couple of competitions over the past few weeks. One of the other teams at the events had settled on high-vis yellow jumpsuits as their uniform, and this irked me.

I went to find a meme and do a crappy edit job on the text, but this showed up first and it's close enough:

Here's the point: Overuse of high-visibility colors desensitizes us to those colors; therefore, this overuse (re-)creates a safety hazard by reducing the effectiveness of our controls.

If your team wears hi-vis vests, that's fine, those are industry standard and not too obnoxious. They're also patterned so that you can see them move as the person inside moves, whereas a solid-colored jumpsuit tends to hide that motion, making the person's movements harder to follow (gee whiz). You can also find high-visibility gloves, which I would recommend, since your hands are working in a confined space full of heavy, stiff, moving parts being handled by other people. (And you should be wearing gloves anyways...I think I'll write that up next.)

There are really many things that should be flagged with high-vis colors, including corners, sharp edges, protruding ends, energy release mechanisms, motion controls, floor hazards, hanging cables... generally anything that would make someone say either "watch out for that" or "ow". So, as with every other tool: Please use high-visibility colors, when and only when appropriate. :)

## Color coding

You should use color coding for quick identification. I won't get into how to use this tool correctly because frankly it's not that hard to figure out. We're going to discuss how _not_ to use it.

Don't use too many colors. If you find yourself needing more than about six colors or so, color coding may be inappropriate. If colors become too close together, to the point that you can't look at it and say "oh that's $COLOR" and then go pick the same exact one out of a list of all the options, your colors are too densely packed and are no longer helpful.

Use vibrant, easy-to-see colors. This kind of goes back to the point above; the bottom line is: **if your ease-of-use tool is difficult to use, it's useless.**

Here's the big kicker: Do NOT rely solely on color to indicate anything. Color blindness is a real thing, and as an engineer, it's a condition that warrants your consideration. If you find yourself with a system whose state can _only_ be identified by color, you need to rework it so that someone who can't tell the difference, can tell the difference. (If you're designing for regular-blind users too, well, I hope you can see how color coding isn't going to help them.)
