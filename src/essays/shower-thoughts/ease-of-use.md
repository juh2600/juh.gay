I think I wrote about this before, but I'm rambling in my hotel room again and it's my web site and you can't tell me what to do, so I'm writing about it again.

The problem with AI, is the same as the problem with spreadsheets, is the same as the problem with the World Wide Web. The barrier to entry is so low that anyone can use the tool without understanding how to use it correctly. You can get pretty far with them before the consequences of your decisions start blocking you. I'm all for tools being easy to use; I think tools should be easy to use _correctly_. In general, I think that they should be impossible to use incorrectly. I think that making a tool easy to use incorrectly constitutes a design flaw.
