_NB: This did not originate as a commentary on chatbots, but it does apply there._

It doesn’t matter whether an idea came from a prisoner, a news anchor, a kindergartner, a chatbot, or a tree. This context may help you understand how they arrived at the idea, but what matters is the merit of the idea on its own. Whether it has merit is for each one of you to decide for yourself. And if you decide that it has merit, then it’s up to you, possibly alone, to fight for it.
