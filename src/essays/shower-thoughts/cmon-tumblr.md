% c'mon tumblr, don't do this

There are three major types of industry standards:

- There are the scientifically validated standards, like good cryptography practices. These you should follow.
- There are the totally arbitrary standards, like abandoning squircles in favor of flat squares. You can do whatever you want ([not that you should](/essays/strong-feelings-about-the-web.md)).
- There are rumors of a pot of gold in the river.

If all the other social media jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?

Context: Tumblr is looking at "fixing" their platform, having acknowledged that it's not "easy to use". The first thing on their list is "encouraging" (word mine) users to become signed-in (read: loginwall). This is bad! Nobody appreciates being forced to sign up for things! They mentioned other things about following industry practices...but do we really want tumblr, renowned for being alive in spite of itself, to end up like twitter, reddit, facebook, snapchat, instagram, and google plus? is that really a good idea?? I want to tell you, dear reader, that it is not! Tumblr is still such a nice place because it's different---or more particularly, the ways that it's different help to make it a nice place (different =/> good, but this different is a part of the good). Why make it the same? Bad!
