This is a list of art ideas I thought would be cute. Feel free to use them! If they turn out nice, let me know :)

- faang-chan (raccoon girl) sticking her head up out of a dumpster with a stack of papers, looking triumphant ([context](https://www.softwaremaxims.com/blog/not-a-supplier))
- ad campaign for taco bell's blahaj blast
- tower of hanoi but the disks are cats
- slice of life telling the story of a new datacenter technician (think Cells at Work)
