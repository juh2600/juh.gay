# o great fool, what unprompted wisdom do you have for us today?

here are some things i recommend to you, stranger:

- working with web frontend? [grow some principles!](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- buy some [whiteboards](https://amazon.com/dp/B06VVBW9BQ) for your home. adhd lifesavers. my god they have changed everything. you'll need [markers](https://amazon.com/dp/B0006HXJFK) too
- keep your water bottle where you can see it. if i can't see it i just forget to drink water
- a jeep should not be your only vehicle
- resin printing is a small but odiferous nightmare, don't get into it unless you have plenty of space to dedicate to a large grow tent or fume hood. ventilate it. give yourself extra room to work and protect your surfaces. also wear gloves and be careful
- acetone will eat through vinyl gloves, so [choose something else](http://amo-csd.lbl.gov/downloads/Chemical%20Resistance%20of%20Gloves.pdf) (latex or butyl) if you're working with it. that's unrelated to the resin printing comments; you should be using isopropanol for resin washing
