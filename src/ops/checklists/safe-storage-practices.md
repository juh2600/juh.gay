- [ ] All fluid containers are stored as close to floor level as possible.
      Rationale: In the event of a leak or spill, the less distance the fluid can fall, the fewer surfaces can be contaminated by the fluid. In the event of a tip or drop, less falling distance and fewer obstacles reduce the likelihood of a puncture and subsequent leak.
	- [ ] Fluids may be stored in lockers (e.g. flammables) when appropriate, but are still arranged as low as possible within the cabinet.
- [ ] Temporary fluid containers are labeled with their contents, fill date, project or purpose, name of person who filled the container, and name of the project owner or point of contact for that container.
